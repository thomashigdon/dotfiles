# Exact Solarized Dark color theme for the color GNU ls utility.
# Designed for dircolors (GNU coreutils) 5.97
#
# This simple theme was simultaneously designed for these terminal color schemes:
# - Solarized dark  (best)
# - Solarized light
# - default dark
# - default light
# with a slight optimization for Solarized Dark.
#
# How the colors were selected:
# - Terminal emulators often have an option typically enabled by default that makes
#   bold a different color.  It is important to leave this option enabled so that
#   you can access the entire 16-color Solarized palette, and not just 8 colors.
# - We favor universality over a greater number of colors.  So we limit the number
#   of colors so that this theme will work out of the box in all terminals,
#   Solarized or not, dark or light.
# - We choose to have the following category of files:
#   NORMAL & FILE, DIR, LINK, EXEC and
#   editable text including source, unimportant text, binary docs & multimedia source
#   files, viewable multimedia, archived/compressed, and unimportant non-text
# - For uniqueness, we stay away from the Solarized foreground colors are -- either
#   base00 (brightyellow) or base0 (brighblue).  However, they can be used if
#   you know what the bg/fg colors of your terminal are, in order to optimize the display.
# - 3 different options are provided: universal, solarized dark, and solarized light.
#   The only difference between the universal scheme and one that's optimized for
#   dark/light is the color of "unimportant" files, which should blend more with the
#   background
# - We note that blue is the hardest color to see on dark bg and yellow is the hardest
#   color to see on light bg (with blue being particularly bad).  So we choose yellow
#   for multimedia files which are usually accessed in a GUI folder browser anyway.
#   And blue is kept for custom use of this scheme's user.
# - See table below to see the assignments.


# Installation instructions:
# This file goes in the /etc directory, and must be world readable.
# You can copy this file to .dir_colors in your $HOME directory to override
# the system defaults.

# COLOR needs one of these arguments: 'tty' colorizes output to ttys, but not
# pipes. 'all' adds color characters to all output. 'none' shuts colorization
# off.
COLOR tty

# Below, there should be one TERM entry for each termtype that is colorizable
